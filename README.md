This is my UX Flow Diagram for an app for my college campus. Its desinged in such a way that it is not just usefull to the students of MPSTME but also to 
the companies that visit our college for placment. At the time of login to this STUDENT PROFILE app the user will be asked if the user is a student or a company. 
Each student has a SAP ID assigned at the time of admission and each company has a company ID created by our college. Once finding your identity, if you are a company 
the app will direct you to a criteria section where company is asked to enter selection criteria for filteration , based on which a list of student matching the criteria
is displayed on the screen. If criteria isn't matched by any student then user (Company) is directed towards exit page. 
User (Company) can drill down to individual students academic and non academic achievements. Under Student user session this app would show you two tabs one 
"Your College" and "Students Progress". Under "Your College" page it will display information regarding upcoming events, amenities in college, clubs and committees and 
library. Under "Your Progress" Page it will show two tabs "Academics" and "Non Academics", under academics it will show students academic progrss history till date and 
in non academic it will show non academic achievements and committees joined till date.
